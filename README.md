Hey you! ☀️

The Mobility Group within the ATTUNE project would like to share some tips on how we can pollute less during our daily commutes in order to reduce our ecological footprint and help the planet! 🌱

Will you give us just 3 minutes of your time? 🕐

First thing first, we advise you to think about what means of transportation you use for your daily commute. Would it be possible to use sustainable solutions for the planet (walking, cycling, public transport...) to travel the same distance?
Our recent survey showed that many students would be in favor of carpooling. Why not try it? It's a great way to save money and make new friends, plus you reduce pollution!
Did you know that in Siena there is a bike sharing service(https://www.bicincitta.com/frmLeStazioniComune.aspx?ID=202) and lots of agreements to use public transport at reduced prices? You can find all this information at this link : https://sostenibilita.unisi.it/mobilita/.

Before we say goodbye, we would also like to invite you to participate in our meme contest on the theme of sustainability, which runs until 13 May on our Instagram page Attune - Italia(https://www.instagram.com/attune_italia/?igsh=NTNoZHd4cWFxbDF2). We hope to see many of you participating! 💚
